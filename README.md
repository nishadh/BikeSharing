## General Information

BoomBikes is a bikesharing service that has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They aspire to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions

We aim to answer the following question by creating a linear regression model from the dataset.

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

According to the final model we have choosen these questions can be answered as following:

- Temperature is **strongly positively correlated** with demand
- Light weathersit is **mostly negatively correlated** with demand
- Year 2019 has **higher demand** compared to year 2018
- Holiday is **gently negatively correlated** with demand
- Winter, Summer and month of September is **somewhat positively correlated** with demand
- Mist weathersit **somewhat negatively correlated** with demand
- Clear weathersit is correlated with demand
- Spring and July month is **somewhat negatively** correlated with demand
